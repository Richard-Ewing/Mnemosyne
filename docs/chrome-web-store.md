## Extension Name
Mnemosyne — Semantic Ledger for AI Trust

## Short Description (132 chars max)
Give your AI tools a trusted source of meaning. Persistent context, contradiction detection, no training on your data.

## Detailed Description
Mnemosyne adds a private semantic ledger to your AI tools so meaning, context, and important facts don't disappear between conversations.

Instead of storing chat history, Mnemosyne records governed meaning with provenance and auditability. This allows AI systems to reference prior context, surface contradictions, and reduce hallucinations caused by silent context loss.

### Key features:

- Persistent context across AI tools and models
- Visibility into what an AI has previously accepted as true
- Automatic contradiction detection
- User-controlled reinforcement and decay
- No training on your data
- Explicit, user-initiated capture only

Mnemosyne is not an AI assistant.
It does not read pages automatically.
It only records what you explicitly choose.
