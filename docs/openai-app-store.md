# OpenAI App Store Metadata

## App Name
Mnemosyne

## Short Description (≤ 80 chars)
Semantic ledger for AI trust and persistent context.

## Long Description
Mnemosyne provides a model-agnostic semantic ledger that records, governs, and audits meaning over time for AI systems and their users.

Instead of storing chat history or prompts, Mnemosyne maintains a governed ledger of claims and contextual meaning that AI systems can reference across conversations and models.

By eliminating silent context loss and surfacing contradictions, Mnemosyne reduces hallucinations without changing how models reason or training on user data.

Mnemosyne is not an assistant.
It is trust infrastructure.
